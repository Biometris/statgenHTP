Description: The statgenHTP package is being developed within the EPPN2020 
    project (<https://eppn2020.plant-phenotyping.eu/>) to streamline the analysis 
    of data coming from high throughput phenotyping platforms. It can be used 
    for spatial analysis of time-series data. 
    Some functions have been created to be used in conjunction with the R 
    package 'asreml' for the 'ASReml' software, which can be obtained upon 
    purchase from 'VSN' international (<http://www.vsni.co.uk/software/asreml>).

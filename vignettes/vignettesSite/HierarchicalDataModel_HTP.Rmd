# Introduction

This document presents the second stage of the two-stage approach proposed by @Perez2022. The aim is modeling the temporal evolution of the genetic signal after a spatial correction is performed on a phenotypic trait (see [**statgenHTP tutorial: 3. Correction for spatial trends**](SpatialModel_HTP.html)). 
Then, datasets are long time-series of spatially corrected plant/plot trajectories, $\tilde{y}_{pgi}$ for the $i$th plant ($i = 1,\ldots,m_{pg}$) of the $g$th genotype $g=1,\ldots,\ell_p$ in the $p$th population ($p= 1,\ldots, k$). We assume that data present a hierarchical structure with $M=\sum_{p=1}^k{\sum_{g=1}^{\ell_p}{m_{pg}}}$ plots nested in $L=\sum_{p=1}^k{\ell_p}$ genotypes, genotypes nested in $k$ populations. To model this sample of curves the following additive decomposition of the phenotypic variation over time is considered, and a P-spline-based three-level nested hierarchical data model is used

$\tilde{y}_{pgi}(t) = f_{p}(t) + f_{pg}(t) + f_{pgi}(t) + \varepsilon_{pgi}(t),\;\;\varepsilon_{pgi}(t)\sim N\left(0, \sigma^{2}w_{pgi}(t)\right),$

where briefly,

* $f_{p}$ is the $p$th population mean function.
* $f_{pg}$ is the genotype-specific deviation from $f_p$ for the $g$th genotype. Note that $f_{p} + f_{pg}$ represents the genotype-specific trajectory for the $g$th genotype.
* $f_{pgi}$ is the plot-specific deviation from $f_{pg}$ for the $i$th plot. In the same way than for the genotypes, $f_{p} + f_{pg} + f_{pgi}$ is the plot-specific trajectory for the $i$th plot.
* $\varepsilon_{pgi}$ is the random noise curve, where $w_{pgi}(\cdot)$ is a weights curve obtained from, e.g., the spatial correction.

An illustration of these curves is as follows, 
```{r CurvesHDMArchFig, out.width='80%', fig.pos='c', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/curvesHDM.png", auto_pdf = TRUE)
```

Note that the functions described in this tutorial can be applied to spatially corrected data (see [**statgenHTP tutorial: 3. Correction for spatial trends**](SpatialModel_HTP.html)) or on raw data. It also allows estimating first- and second-order derivative curves from trajectory and deviation curves at the three levels of the hierarchy. All these curves can be used as input to extract time‐independent parameters to characterise genotypes (see [**statgenHTP tutorial: 6. Estimation of parameters from time courses**](ParameterEstimation_HTP.html)). 

To illustrate the analysis, we use the spatially corrected leaf area from the PhenoArch data `data(spatCorrectedArch)`. We assume that plots (`plotId`, $M = 1673$) are nested in genotypes (`genotype`, $L = 90$), and genotypes are nested in populations (`geno.decomp`, $k = 4$). The following plot depicts the kind of trajectories that are modelled here  

```{r visualiseData, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.height=3, fig.width=7, fig.pos='c',}
ggplot2::ggplot(data = spatCorrectedArch,
                ggplot2::aes(x= timeNumber, y = LeafArea_corr, group = plotId)) +
  ggplot2::geom_line(na.rm = TRUE) +
  ggplot2::facet_grid(~geno.decomp) +
  ggplot2::labs(x = "DOY", y = "Spatially corrected leaf area")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Fit the P-spline Hierarchical Curve Data Model (PsHDM)
Before starting with the fitting process, for this specific example we first need to specify the genotype-by-treatment interaction. As is explained in @Perez2022, the actual implementation with the PsHDM does not allow for crossed but nested effects. For a proper analysis of this dataset with this model, we combine the genotype and the water regime information, which results in $L = 180$ genotypes (`genoTreat` = $90$ `genotype` $\times$ $2$ `treat`). 

```{r newVarVatorNum, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
## Extracting the treatment: water regime (WW, WD).
spatCorrectedArch[["treat"]] <- substr(spatCorrectedArch[["geno.decomp"]],
                                      start = 1, stop = 2)

## Specifying the genotype-by-treatment interaction.
spatCorrectedArch[["genoTreat"]] <-
  interaction(spatCorrectedArch[["genotype"]],
             spatCorrectedArch[["treat"]], sep = "_")
```

To fit the PsHDM, we use the `fitSplineHDM` function with cubic ($bdeg = 3$) B-spline basis of dimension, e.g., $b_{pop}=b_{gen}=b_{plot}=10$ and second order penalties ($pord=2$) to represent $f_p$, $f_{pg}$ and $f_{pgi}$. Note that the `fitSplineHDM` function uses as argument the number of segments `nseg` instead of the number of B-spline basis $b$ (`nseg` = $b$ - `bdeg`, that is, for our example, if $b=10$ then `nseg` = 7). We encourage the user to try different values for `nseg` and compare the results. 

> Note: If the user prefers to use different penalty orders and/or B-spline degree values, the parameterisation proposed by @Wood2013 is used by the `fitSplineHDM` function to specify the $\boldsymbol{X}$ design matrix in the mixed model formulation. 

With the `difVar` argument, the user can also specify if the genetic variation varies across populations (`geno = TRUE`) and the plant variation changes across genotypes (`plot=TRUE`). Consequently, the number of variance components, `fit.psHDM$vc` (and effective dimension, `fit.psHDM$ed`) will increase with the number of populations and/or genotypes, while the number of coefficients will remain the same.

If `trace = TRUE` a report with changes in deviance and effective dimension is printed by iteration. It is useful to understand the importance of model components [@RodAlv2018], as well as to detect convergence problems. 

Under this model configuration, the mixed model formulation of the PsHDM has a total of 18570 regression coefficients (both fixed and random $4 \times 10 + 180 \times 10 + 1673 \times 10$) and $11$ variance components. Estimation took approximately 40 seconds in a (64-bit) \texttt{R} 4.2.1 and a 1.60GHz Dual-Core\textsuperscript{TM} i5 processor computer with 16GB of RAM and macOS Monterrey Version 12.5. The fitting can also be performed for a subset of genotypes or plots. The user only needs to specify the desired vector of `genotypes` and/or `plotIds`.

Note that numerical time is required to fit the PsHDM. If the  `timeNumber` column is used as it is returned by the `getCorrected` function, the user has to be aware that it is a simple enumeration of the timepoints. Care must be taken when dealing with non-equidistant timepoints to keep the same time scale as in the original `timePoint` column. If `useTimeNumber = FALSE`, an internal numerical transformation of the time points is made (and returned) using the first time point as origin. The user can also specify any other numerical time transformation. For instance, in this example, we provide a new column called `DOY` with time in days of the year. 

```{r fitSplineHDMVatorNum, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=TRUE}

## Create a new timeNumber with days of the year (DOY)
spatCorrectedArch[["DOY"]] <- as.numeric(strftime(spatCorrectedArch$timePoint, format = "%j"))

## Fit P-Splines Hierarchical Curve Data Model for all genotypes.
fit.psHDM  <- fitSplineHDM(inDat = spatCorrectedArch,
                           trait = "LeafArea_corr",
                           pop = "geno.decomp",
                           genotype = "genoTreat",
                           plotId = "plotId",
                           difVar = list(geno = FALSE, plot = FALSE),
                           smoothPop = list(nseg = 7, bdeg = 3, pord = 2),
                           smoothGeno = list(nseg = 7, bdeg = 3, pord = 2),
                           smoothPlot = list(nseg = 7, bdeg = 3, pord = 2),
                           weights = "wt",
                           trace = TRUE,
                           timeNumber = "DOY",
                           useTimeNumber = TRUE)
```

The resulting object, in this case `fit.psHDM`, contains different information about the data structure, the model fitting, and three data frames with the estimated curves at each of the three-levels of the hierarchy (population, genotypes and plots). That is, estimated time series of trajectories and deviations, and their first and second-order derivatives. For a detailed description of the returned values see `help(fitSplineHDM)`. An example of the estimated curves structure is given bellow. 

`fit.psHDM$popLevel` contains, for each population (`pop`), estimated population trajectories ($\hat{f}_p$, `fPop`) as well as their first ($\hat{f}'_p$, `fPopDeriv1`) and second-order ($\hat{f}''_p$, `fPopDeriv2`) derivatives

```{r headPopFittedValues, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
knitr::kable(head(fit.psHDM$popLevel), align=c('c','c'), booktabs = TRUE, caption = 'Estimated curves at population level')
```

`fit.psHDM$genoLevel` contains, for each genotype (`genotype`) in a population (`pop`)

* Estimated genotype deviations ($\hat{f}_{pg}$, `fGeno`) as well as their first ($\hat{f}'_{pg}$, `fGenoDeriv1`) and second-order ($\hat{f}''_{pg}$, `fGenoDeriv2`) derivatives.

* Estimated genotype trajectories ($\hat{f}_{p} +\hat{f}_{pg}$, `fGenoDev`) as well as their first ($\hat{f}'_{p} +\hat{f}'_{pg}$, `fGenoDevDeriv1`) and second-order ($\hat{f}''_{p} +\hat{f}''_{pg}$, `fGenoDevDeriv2`) derivatives.

```{r headGenoFittedValues, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
knitr::kable(head(fit.psHDM$genoLevel), align=c('c','c'), booktabs = TRUE, caption = 'Estimated curves at genotype level')
```

`fit.psHDM$plotLevel` contains, for each plot (`plotId`) in a genotype (`genotype`) in a population (`pop`)

* Estimated plot deviations ($\hat{f}_{pgi}$, `fPlot`) as well as their first ($\hat{f}'_{pgi}$, `fPlotDeriv1`) and second-order ($\hat{f}''_{pgi}$, `fPlotDeriv2`) derivatives.

* Estimated plot trajectories ($\hat{f}_{p} +\hat{f}_{pg}+\hat{f}_{pgi}$, `fPlotDev`) as well as their first ($\hat{f}'_{p} +\hat{f}'_{pg}+\hat{f}'_{pgi}$, `fPlotDevDeriv1`) and second-order ($\hat{f}''_{p} +\hat{f}''_{pg}+\hat{f}''_{pgi}$, `fPlotDevDeriv2`) derivatives. It also returns the original `trait` values ($\tilde{y}_{pgi}$, `ObsPlot`).

```{r headPlotFittedValues, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
knitr::kable(head(fit.psHDM$plotLevel), align=c('c','c'), booktabs = TRUE, caption = 'Estimated curves at plot level')
```

# Predict the P-spline Hierarchical Curve Data Model
The `predict.psHDM` function can be used to predict the PsHDM after the fitting process is performed (with the `fitSplineHDM` function). This function allows predictions can be performed on a denser grid of time points, and it also allows for standard error calculation for curves at each level of the hierarchy, which can be used to construct (approximate) pointwise confidence intervals for the estimated curves. 

> Note 1: As a hierarchical model is assumed, predictions at inner levels (genotypes and plots) require predictions at outer levels (populations and genotypes). That is, if the user only wants predictions at genotype level (`geno = TRUE`), then predictions at population level (`pop = TRUE`) should be calculated as well.

> Note 2: If newtimes are not especified, the original time points are used.

> Note 3: Standard errors at the plot level demand large memory and time. For this example, if we use the original time points, estimation take approximately 20 minutes in a (64-bit) \texttt{R} 4.2.1 and a 1.60GHz Dual-Core\textsuperscript{TM} i5 processor computer with 16GB of RAM and macOS Monterrey Version 12.5. If it is not necessary, we suggest the user to set the standard errors (`se`) at the `plot` level as `FALSE`. For comparison, if `plot = FALSE` for the standard errors argument, the computation time for the same example is 4 seconds approximately.

In the following example, we use the previous `fit.psHDM` object to make predictions at the three levels of the hierarchy and standard errors at the population and genotype levels. The original data is measured at 33 time points. Predictions are performed at 100 time points in the same range than the original time points.

```{r predictSplineHDMVatorNum, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=TRUE}

## Predict the P-Splines Hierarchical Curve Data Model on a dense grid
## with standard errors at the population and genotype levels
pred.psHDM <- predict(object = fit.psHDM,
                      newtimes = seq(min(fit.psHDM$time[["timeNumber"]]),
                                     max(fit.psHDM$time[["timeNumber"]]),
                                     length.out = 100),
                      pred = list(pop = TRUE, geno = TRUE, plot = TRUE),
                      se = list(pop = TRUE, geno = TRUE, plot = FALSE),
                      trace = FALSE)
```

As result, three data frames with predictions (and standard errors) at population (`pred.psHDM$popLevel`), genotype (`pred.psHDM$GenoLevel`) and plot (`pred.psHDM$plotLevel`) levels are returned, as shown below

```{r headPredValues, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
knitr::kable(head(pred.psHDM$popLevel), align=c('c','c'), booktabs = TRUE, caption = 'Predicted curves and standard errors at population level')
knitr::kable(head(pred.psHDM$genoLevel), align=c('c','c'), booktabs = TRUE, caption = 'Predicted curves and standard errors at genotype level')
knitr::kable(head(pred.psHDM$plotLevel), align=c('c','c'), booktabs = TRUE, caption = 'Predicted curves and standard errors at plot level')
```

> Note: if the original time points are used for predictions, the data frame at plot level (`pred.psHDM$plotLevel`) will have an additional column (`obsPlot`) with the raw data. Otherwise, an additional data frame (`pred.psHDM$plotObs`) with the raw data will be returned.

# Plot the P-spline Hierarchical Curve Data Model
The `plot.psHDM` function plots `psHDM` objects (as obtained from `fitSplineHDM` and `predict.psHDM`), which contains information about trajectories, deviations and first-order derivatives at the three levels of the hierarchy. In addition, if a `predict.psHDM` object is used, $95\%$ point wise confidence intervals are depicted. To illustrate this example, we will use `x = pred.psHDM`, as obtained in the prediction section.

## Plots at population level
If `plotType = "popTra"`, population-specific trajectories are depicted ($\hat{f}_p(t)$) separately for each population, and their $95\%$ point wise confidence intervals. Additionally, the grey lines represent the `trait` that is used in the `fitSplineHDM` function at the plot level ($\tilde{y}_{pgi}$).  

```{r plotPredPopVator, fig.height=4, fig.width=7, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
## Population-specific trajectories.
plot(pred.psHDM, plotType = "popTra", themeSizeHDM = 10)
```

## Plots at genotype level
At genotype level we can visualise three plots:

* If `plotType = "popGenoTra"`, population ($\hat{f}_p(t)$) and genotype-specific ($\hat{f}_p(t)+\hat{f}_{pg}(t)$) trajectories are depicted for all genotypes separately for each population. $95\%$ point wise confidence intervals are depicted for population trajectories.  

```{r plotPredGenoTraVator, fig.height=4, fig.width=7, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
## Population and genotype-specific trajectories.
plot(pred.psHDM, plotType = "popGenoTra", themeSizeHDM = 10)
```

* If `plotType = "popGenoDeriv"`, first-order derivative of the population ($\hat{f}'_p(t)$) and genotype-specific ($\hat{f}'_p(t)+\hat{f}'_{pg}(t)$) trajectories are depicted for all genotypes separately for each population. $95\%$ point wise confidence intervals are depicted for the first-order derivative of the population trajectories.  
 

```{r plotPredGenoDerivVator, fig.height=4, fig.width=7, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
## First-order derivative of the population- and genotype-specific trajectories.
plot(pred.psHDM, plotType = "popGenoDeriv", themeSizeHDM = 10)
```

* If `plotType = "GenoDev"`, genotype-specific deviations ($\hat{f}_{pg}(t)$) are depicted for all genotypes separately for each population.   

```{r plotPredGenoDevVator, fig.height=4, fig.width=7, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
## Genotype-specific deviations.
plot(pred.psHDM, plotType = "genoDev", themeSizeHDM = 10)
```

## Plots at plot level

If `plotType = "genoPlotTra"`, genotype ($\hat{f}_p(t)+\hat{f}_{pg}(t)$) and plot-specific ($\hat{f}_p(t)+\hat{f}_{pg}(t)+\hat{f}_{pgi}(t)$) trajectories are depicted for all plots separately for a selection of genotypes. Additional $95\%$ point wise confidence intervals are depicted for genotype-specific trajectories. For this `plotType`, the user has the option to change names (`genotypeNames`) and/or order (`genotypeOrder`) of the selected genotypes. 

```{r plotPredPlotVator, fig.height=7, fig.width=7, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
## As an example we used ten randomly selected genotypes 
set.seed(1)
plot.genos  <- sample(pred.psHDM$genoLevel$genotype,10, replace = FALSE)
names.genos <- substring(plot.genos, first = 5)

## Genotype- and plot-specific trajectories.
plot(pred.psHDM, 
     plotType = "genoPlotTra", 
     genotypes = plot.genos, genotypeNames = names.genos,
     themeSizeHDM = 10)
```

#' Field data for a wheat experiment in Chili.
#'
#' A dataset containing field data from an experiment with wheat in Chili
#' described in detail by Lado (2013). The experiment was performed in 2
#' locations in Chili with 2 different drought regimes in 2011 and 2012 for
#' the first location and 1 trial in 2012 for the second location. For 384
#' genotypes 4 traits were measured in 2011 but in 2012 only grain yield was
#' measured.

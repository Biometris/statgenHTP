\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class "psHDM" as obtained after fitting
(\code{\link{fitSplineHDM}}) the P-spline Hierarchical Curve Data Model}

\item{newtimes}{A numeric vector with timepoints at which predictions are
desired}

\item{pred}{A list that controls the hierarchical levels at which
predictions are desired (population/genotypes/plots).  The default is
\code{TRUE}.}

\item{se}{A list that controls the hierarchical levels at which standard
errors are desired (population/genotypes/plots).  The default is
\code{TRUE} except at the plot level.}

\item{trace}{An optional value that controls the function trace.
The default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{...}{Not used.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{psHDM}, a list with the following outputs:
predict.psHDM
\code{newtimes} A numeric vector with the timepoints at which predictions
and/or standard errors have been obtained.
\code{popLevel} A data.frame with the estimated population trajectories
and first and second order derivatives, and if required their respective
standard errors, at the \code{newtimes}.
\code{genoLevel} A data.frame with the estimated genotype-specific
deviations and trajectories and their respective first and second order
derivatives, and if required their respective standard errors,
at the \code{newtimes}.
\code{plotLevel} A data.frame with the estimated plot-specific
deviations and trajectories and their respective first and second order
derivatives, and if required their respective standard errors,
at the \code{newtimes}.
\code{plotObs} A data.frame with the raw data at the original timepoints.

\description{
Function that predicts the P-spline Hierarchical Curve Data Model (see
\code{\link{fitSplineHDM}}) on a dense grid. It provides standard errors
for curves at each level of the hierarchy. User has to be aware that
standard errors at the plot level demand large memory. We suggest set
that option at the \code{FALSE} level
}
\examples{
## Predict the P-Splines Hierarchical Curve Data Model in a dense grid
## with standard errors at the population and genotype levels
pred.psHDM <- predict(object = fit.psHDM,
                     newtimes = seq(min(fit.psHDM$time),
                                   max(fit.psHDM$time), length.out = 100),
                     pred = list(pop = TRUE, geno = TRUE, plot = TRUE),
                     se = list(pop = TRUE, geno = TRUE, plot = FALSE))

## Plot the P-Spline predictions at the three levels of the hierarchy
## Plots at plot level for some genotypes (as illustration)
plot(x = pred.psHDM,
    geno.sub = c("GenoA14_WD","GenoA51_WD","GenoB11_WW","GenoB02_WD","GenoB02_WW"),
    theme.HDM = theme.HDM())

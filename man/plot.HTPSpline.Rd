\title{Plot the results of a fitted spline.}
\usage{
\method{plot}{HTPSpline}(
  x,
  ...,
  plotType = c("predictions", "derivatives"),
  genotypes = NULL,
  plotIds = NULL,
  title = NULL,
  output = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class HTPSpline.}

\item{...}{Extra plot options. Described per plotType in their respective
section.}

\item{plotType}{A single character string indicating which plot should be
made. See the sections below for a detailed explanation of the plots.}

\item{genotypes}{A character vector indicating the genotypes for which
splines should be plotted.}

\item{plotIds}{A character vector indicating the plotIds for which splines
should be plotted.}

\item{title}{A character string used as title for the plot. If \code{NULL} a
default title is added to the plot depending on \code{plotType}.}

\item{output}{Should the plot be output to the current device? If
\code{FALSE} only a list of ggplot objects is invisibly returned. Ignored if
\code{outFile} is specified.}

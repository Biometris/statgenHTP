\description{
Fit the P-spline Hierarchical Curve Data Model used in the second stage of
the two-stage approach proposed by Pérez-Valencia et al. (2022). This model
assumes a three-level hierarchical structure in the data, with plants nested
in genotypes, genotypes nested in populations. The input for this function
is the spatially corrected data, as obtained from the first stage of the
approach (see \code{\link{fitModels}} and \code{\link{getCorrected}}).
The number of segments is chosen by the user, as well as the B-spline degree,
and the penalty order for the three-levels of the hierarchy. The user can
also decide if different variances for random effects at genotype (separately
for each population) and plant (separately for each genotype) levels are
desired. The function outputs are fitted values (time series of trajectories
and deviations) and their first and second derivatives for the three-levels
of the hierarchy. The outputs can then be used to estimate relevant parameters
from the curves for further analysis (see \code{\link{estimateSplineParameters}}).
